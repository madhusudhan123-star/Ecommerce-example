This is an example of an eCommerce website. I have developed by using API data that the website is fully focused on fetching the data from API. Please donâ€™t rate the design please the design and colors do not match because I have said before only I have focused on fetching data.
Projects used the APi is https://fakestoreapi.com/
this API is very use full  for pratice developer of fetching the data.
For little bit of css used the Tailwind. it is a greate one with less code we develop better design. but for that advance design I can't say becouse I am using for the first time.
Thank you.
